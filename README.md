# Asteroid-Game
Asteroid Game in SDL2 and C++

Created a satanic version of the game in which you use WASD keys to move around with your ship and press space to shoot lasers and destroy asteroids.
It uses basic Newtonian physics which means everything on the screen accelerates (asteroids to infinity, ship only by pressing W or D).
